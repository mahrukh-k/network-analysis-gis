# Introduction
After the recent devastating earthquake in Turkey, scientists are finding clues of similar future events in California. The State of California lies at the 800-mile long San Andreas Fault line and has experienced two major earthquakes in the past which were similar in magnitude to the one in Turkey. In addition to the risk of powerful earthquakes, regions in California have also experienced huge wildfires in recent years due to global warming. These natural hazards place the populations in California at high-risk and call for comprehensive safety measures.

# Problem statement
In an attempt to assist the search and rescue efforts in case of a calamity, this project aims to create a study area outlining the high-risk zones and identifying the housing structures that are particularly at high-risk due to their structural foundations. The goal of creating this study area is to enable the government and service providers to provide fast response by having all relevant features (risk zones, structures, populations) in one map. In addition, this project will present a comprehensive analysis of housing structures that are at high-risk in the event of an earthquake, and the closest emergency service providers in the event of a disaster.

This project focuses on the State of California in U.S. and will cover information on housing structures and regions that are at high-risk of natural disasters including earthquakes and wildfires.

# Data sources
- U.S. State boundaries
- Data on natural hazards
o   Housing structures - Living Atlas: feature layer at the census-tract level of houses built in each decade. I will be using data for housing structures built pre 1930s.
o   Fire zones - The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection: raster layer of five threat classes (low, moderate, high, very high, extreme) of fire across California.
o   Earthquake shaking potential - California Open Data Portal: shape file (polygons) of average shaking potential across California.
o   Earthquake zones - California State Geoportal: shape file (polygon) of earthquake fault lines in California.
o   Landslide zones - California Open Data Portal: shape file (polygons) of landslide zones across California.
- Data on service providers
o   Fire stations - California Governor's Office of Emergency Services GIS Data Hub: shape file (point) of fire stations location and address across U.S. 
o   Emergency shelters - Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD): shape file (point) of emergency shelters location and address across U.S. 
o   Healthcare facilities - California State Geoportal: shape file (point) of fire stations location and address across California.
